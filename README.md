# Lodash Number training

##Summary

Training tasks for Lodash Number. The exercise consist of a few simple tasks.
You are supposed to implement method, having provided only the method name and purpose.

##Goal

Tests contain some usage of lodash methods.
Make sure that datasets `app/datasets.js` for each method are correct.

### _.clamp

Clamps number within the inclusive lower and upper bounds.

### _.inRange

Checks if n is between start and up to, but not including, end. 
If end is not specified, itâ€™s set to start with start then set to 0. 
If start is greater than end the params are swapped to support negative ranges.

### _.random

Produces a random number between the inclusive lower and upper bounds. 
If only one argument is provided a number between 0 and the given number is returned. 
If floating is true, or either lower or upper are floats, a floating-point number is returned instead of an integer.
